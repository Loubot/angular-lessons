Hi,

We are looking for teachers to help us test out a new (and free :)) Irish tutoring website and I am wondering if you would be interested. The website is www.learnyourlesson.ie which is an online marketplace where students can find the best teachers in their area. 

Marketing
We make it our mission to advertise your services â€“ which leaves you to focus all your time on teaching. Its 100% free for you to use. We do not charge any commission, so you are free to work as many hours as you like.

If you would be interested in sparing some of your time to help us improve the website for teachers we would be so grateful. Or even if you just want to create a profile (it takes about 3 minutes) and send us any feedback, that would also be cool. You can email me at any time. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Louis
